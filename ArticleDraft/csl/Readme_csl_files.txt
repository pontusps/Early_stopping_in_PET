The "csl" file is a file that specifies the formatting of the references. You can find basically all Journal-specific csl-files on this github repo: https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles

Just copy and paste in the csl file into the YAML-header (the top of the Rmarkdown document) for the relevant journal you are interested in.
